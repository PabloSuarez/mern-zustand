# Web with Authentication using the MERN Stack

This project is a web application that utilizes the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) to create a platform with authentication. Additionally, it employs TypeScript in both the Backend (Node.js) and Frontend (React) and uses Zustand as a library to manage the global state of the application.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend** (Node.js) and **Frontend** (React) developed with TypeScript.
- **Database**: MongoDB.
- **Server**: Express.js.
- **User Interface**: React with Zustand for global state management.

## What is the MERN Stack?

The MERN Stack is a widely-used set of technologies for developing modern web applications. It consists of:

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): A highly-scalable NoSQL database.
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): A web application framework for Node.js.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): A JavaScript runtime environment on the server-side.

This project combines these technologies to create a web application with secure and efficient authentication.
